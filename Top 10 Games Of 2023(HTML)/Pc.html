            <br>
            <p style="color: aliceblue;" align = "center">->  In Apex Legends, players in squads of two or three select a character with pre-set abilities, referred to as a Legend, and battle against other players to be the last squad standing. Players earn experience based on their performance in matches, through which they can earn Apex Packs that contain cosmetic items. Cosmetics can also be purchased from the in-game store, earned through seasonal Battle Passes, or awarded through limited-time events.

                In a standard Battle Royale match, all 60 players start in the same dropship flying over the map, and each squad can decide when and where they want to skydive onto the island below. Squads will then scavenge for weapons, materials, and loot, and work with their squadmates to combat other players. When an enemy dies, they drop a deathbox containing all of their loot, which can then be accessed by everybody. Though Apex Legends has both voice and text team chat like most multiplayer first-person shooters, it also includes a ping system so that players can communicate simple concepts without external inputs. Players can also revive any squadmate downed by enemies and respawn squadmates who die by retrieving their Banner from their deathbox. The match is divided into rounds, marked by the shrinking stages of the Ring, which makes the playable area narrower and narrower until eventually enveloping the entire map. In addition, Care Packages and Replicators are periodically dropped into the playable area to provide extra loot.</p>

            <p style="color: aliceblue;" align = "center">-> A gritty crime thriller with a dreamlike tone and dense postmodern flourishes, the survival horror video game Alan Wake 2 is often weird and always unpredictable, veering off from its small-town murder-mystery setting to follow surreal and mind-bending digressions. It has few, if any, video game precedents.

                But Alan Wake 2, which has received effusive praise for its tense atmosphere, innovative style and sophisticated writing, does take inspiration from a variety of other art forms, drawing on experimental fiction, art house film, immersive theater and more.
                
                The first Alan Wake, released by the Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment in 2010, was widely regarded as a Stephen King riff: Its tale of a troubled novelist facing a nightmare straight out of one of his own tales was reminiscent of King’s stories “Bag of Bones,” “1408” and “Secret Window, Secret Garden.” But according to the Remedy writer and director Sam Lake, those comparisons downplayed the sweep of the game’s influences.</p>

            <p style="color: aliceblue;" align = "center">-> VALORANT is a competitive tactical shooter from the first-person perspective. It takes place on a near-future Earth and features a cast of characters known as agents, each of which have their own unique set of abilities to create tactical opportunities.

                Ten players are divided into two teams, Attackers and Defenders, with the goal of winning the most rounds. In order to win a round, a team must eliminate the opposing team or complete their team-specific spike objective. First team who reaches 13 rounds, wins the game. The game starts in a lobby, where players have to lock in their Agent. The lobby lasts for 80 seconds or until everyone has locked in their Agent. Only one of each Agent can be selected on each team and players cannot see which Agent has been picked on the opposing team until the first Buy Phase. The Buy Phase occurs before each round and lasts for 30 seconds. During Buy Phase, most areas of the map are inaccessible and the two teams cannot meet each other. Therefore, Attackers cannot enter sites and are only limited to areas near their spawn zone, while the Defenders can move freely between sites, but not further than that. Players are also allowed to buy weapons, shields, and abilities during this phase.</p>
