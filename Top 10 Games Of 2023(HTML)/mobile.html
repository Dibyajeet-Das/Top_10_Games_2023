        <p style="color: aliceblue;" align = "center">-> Pokémon GO is a mobile augmented reality (AR) game developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. The game was released in July 2016 for iOS and Android devices. Pokémon GO is part of the Pokémon franchise, which originated with the Pokémon video games and includes various forms of media.
        In Pokémon GO, players use their mobile devices' GPS and camera to explore the real world and catch virtual Pokémon that appear on the screen. The game encourages outdoor exploration and social interaction as players can encounter Pokémon in different locations, and various landmarks and real-world points of interest serve as PokéStops and Gyms in the game.
            <br>
            The primary objective of Pokémon GO is to catch Pokémon, train them, and battle other players at Gyms. The game uses augmented reality technology to overlay Pokémon onto the real-world environment, making it seem as though the creatures are present in the player's surroundings.
            
            Since its launch, Pokémon GO has received regular updates, introducing new features, generations of Pokémon, and special events. The game's success is attributed to its innovative use of augmented reality, the nostalgic appeal of Pokémon, and the community aspect, as players often collaborate during special events or while participating in raids.</p>

            online by joining a game with strangers, or players can host or join games with friends.The premise of the game is simple – players are given the role of either a crewmate or an impostor. The crewmates must complete a list of tasks on a spaceship to get it ready for departure. Some tasks such as ‘Clean O2 Filter’ are relatively quick to complete, while others such as ‘Fix Weather Node’ require multiple steps. However, the game has at least one impostor who is trying to sabotage the ship and kill all the crew. As the game continues the impostor undermines and starts to kill members of the crew. The game is paused when a body is discovered or to call an emergency meeting to discuss who the impostor might be and why. Players will have been paying attention to the behaviour of others in the game to try and figure out who the impostor on the ship is. During the discussion players will vote for who they think was acting suspiciously enough to be the impostor. If a player gets enough votes they will be ejected from the game, and whether they were a crewmate, or an impostor will be revealed.
            <br>
            To win the game the crewmates must complete all the tasks or discover the impostor. The impostor will win if they can avoid detection and kill off the whole crew.</p>

        <p style="color: aliceblue;" align = "center">-> Roblox is an app that allows users to play a wide variety of games, create games, and chat with others online. It combines gaming, social media, and social commerce. Billing itself as the “ultimate virtual universe,” Roblox experiences are places where users can socialize, build their own spaces, and even earn and spend virtual money.

            Games on Roblox are officially called “experiences” which fall into a variety of genres. Users can dabble in games tagged as roleplay, adventure, fighting, obby (obstacle courses), tycoon, simulator, and more.
            <br>
            Many of the most popular games on the app, including Adopt Me! And Brookhaven RP, fall into the roleplay category. These are less games and more virtual hangouts. Millennials, think of them like Gen Z’s version of Club Penguin. Other categories focus more on agility, strategy, or skill.
            <br>
            Though the platform itself is free, users can make purchases within each experience. A portion of the sales (about 28 cents per dollar spent) goes back to the game’s creator. That means brands and makers of all ages can earn money if the games they build become popular. It really takes user-generated content to a whole new level.</p>
